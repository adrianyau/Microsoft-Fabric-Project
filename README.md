# Microsoft Fabric Project

## Project/Goals
In 2023, Microsoft launched Microsoft Fabric, a new end-to-end data analytics platform, to create a combined infrastructure for data integration, data warehousing, data engineering, real-time analytics, and business intelligence.  The advantage for this single unified experience is for organizations to manage data access and reduce costs without cobbling data and analytics systems from multiple vendors.  With the increased adoption of artificial intelligence on how the entire industry is doing business, Microsoft applied CoPilot to Microsoft Fabric to make it easier for users with no experience to build data pipelines, generate code, and build machine learning models.

My project is to test Microsoft Fabric based on fundamental knowledge using sample data for uploading, cleaning, transforming, and reporting.
