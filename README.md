# Microsoft Fabric Project

## Project/Goals
In 2023, Microsoft launched Microsoft Fabric, a new end-to-end data analytics platform, to create an umbrella for data integration, data warehousing, data engineering, real-time analytics, and business intelligence.  The advantage for this single unified experience is for organizations to manage data access and reduce costs without cobbling data systems from multiple vendors.  In the era of artificial intelligence on how the entire industry is doing business, Microsoft applied CoPilot to Microsoft Fabric to make it easier for users with no data experience to build data pipelines, generate code, and build machine learning models.  Microsoft Fabric is looking to revolutionize how businesses approach data analytics to make data-driven decisions.

My project is to test Microsoft Fabric using sample data for uploading, cleaning, transforming, and reporting.
