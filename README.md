# Microsoft Fabric Project

## Project/Goals
In 2023, Microsoft launched Microsoft Fabric, a new end-to-end data analytics platform, to create an combined product for data integration, data warehousing, data engineering, real-time analytics, and business intelligence.  The advantage for this single unified experience is for organizations to manage data access and reduce costs without cobbling data systems from multiple vendors.  In the era of artificial intelligence on how the entire industry is doing business, Microsoft applied CoPilot to Microsoft Fabric to make it easier for users with no data experience to build data pipelines, generate code, and build machine learning models.  Microsoft Fabric is looking to revolutionize how businesses approach data analytics to make data-driven decisions.

My project is to test Microsoft Fabric using sample data for uploading, cleaning, transforming, and reporting.

## Process
1. Create a Workspace - The place for collaboration to create files, such as lakehouses, warehouses, reports, and task flows, with different levels of permissions and management access.

2. Create a Lakehouse - The storage of data with different files formats.

3. Create a Warehouse - The consolidation of structured data to be queried and optimized for reporting.

4. Create a Pipeline - The process of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from the Lakehouse to Warehouse creating tables under a schema.

5. Clean and Transform Data - T-SQL is used to interact with relational databases.

6. Create Tables for Staging - The refinement of data tables to be used for presentation.

7. Create Semantic Model Layout - The establishment of relationships between data model sets.

8. Create Power BI Report - The visual analysis displayed for the audience.

## Results
- 111 brands with 1,160 unique products.
- Top 5 Brands: Hermanos, Tell Tale, Ebony, Tri-State, and High Top.
- 833,489 Quantities Sold vs. 8,289 Quantities Returned (0.99% Return Rate) from 1997 to 1998.

## Challenges
- Microsoft Power BI in Microsoft Fabric has basic visual tools and filters in comparison to the desktop version of Microsoft Power BI.

## Future Goals
- Utilize the full capabilities of Microsoft Power BI Desktop to get DAX Measures and Map Visuals.
